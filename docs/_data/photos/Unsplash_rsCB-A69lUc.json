  "content_text": "We were exploring old abandoned gun emplacements in Wellington. The entire place, covered in amazing colorful graffiti. As a result of the graffiti there were old, used spray cans laying all over the place. But this one corridor had two large square indents, opposite one another. The one on the right was almost empty, containing only dust and rubbish, polluted by inconsiderate people. However the square indent on the right was astonishing, packed with at least a hundred used spray cans, a work of art. A beautiful reminder that youâ€™ll never know what you find, unless you go looking.",
