  "content_text": "Ornament of perception // At the moment when sun was going down and I was finishing my weekend getting ready for new work week, I looked through the window and decided to take my old camera for a small experiment.

That is how appeared the cover for my DIY music release which is called Ornament of Perception. \r\n\r\nhttps://ross-savchyn.bandcamp.com/",
