  "content_text": "Me and my friends were waiting for a train When I took this shot. I like it because there is some sense of unknown and mystery to it. A train that we don’t know where it leads inside the dark tunnels.We spent only two days in Berlin. We were heading to club matrix here. I can never forget this night. we got lost from 1 AM till 4 AM. Froze to death during February.\r\nI’ve written this text for this photo:\r\n“Just minutes away from the unknown, dark tunnels waiting ahead and I’m still here without a weapon.”",
