  "content_text": "When I was homeless on the streets of Los Angeles I came across an amazing mural with a water pipe sticking out of the wall just in the right place at the corner of the eye where we would shed our tears. I captured this mural just in time because a week after it was destroyed by construction workers. They have covered the mural with solid paint and it as gone. This is one of those rare gifts that is worth capturing before they disappear forever.",
