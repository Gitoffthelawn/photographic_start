  "content_text": "I happened to take this on my way to the Post Office in Belfast and decided to take the underpass for safety.  I just loved the feel of it and the guy walking added to the atmosphere.The colours really popped when I ran it through Lightroom - HOWEVER this pic was taken with my trusty old iPhone 6 Plus and despite having full frame Nikon cameras and great glass at my disposal this phone still astounds me with the onboard camera.  They say the best camera is the one you have with you and the 6 plus is always with me.",
