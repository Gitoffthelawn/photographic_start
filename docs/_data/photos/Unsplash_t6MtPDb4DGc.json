  "content_text": "My friend and I drove for four hours from San Francisco to Yosemite Valley, California, and when we arrived we couldnâ€™t get a space in a campsite. So we had to make it a day trip and drive all the way back again that evening, however just before we left we went up to Glacier Point to catch the sunset. Seeing the tip of the magnificent Half Dome crowned in pinkish-gold like this as the light faded made the whole trip worth it.",
